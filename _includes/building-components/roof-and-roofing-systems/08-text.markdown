Wayfinding signage elements will be documented by a signage consultant if your job has one - in that case we only do setting-out in B and E series general arrangement plans.

Statutory signage (e.g.<span class="transform-to-uppercase">Fire doors keep closed</span>, etc.) is most often associated with the doors and scheduled as part of J series door schedule.
