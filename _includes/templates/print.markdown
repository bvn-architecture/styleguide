## Print

Operating the ‘print’ command will open a dialogue box including instructions for using pre-printed letterhead stock. When using pre-printed stock you need to hide BVN graphics (toggle print graphics) and print on one side only.
Pre-printed letterheads incorporate the BVN mark and relevant address with 5 different graphic backgrounds.
