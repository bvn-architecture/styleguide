## Print

<div class="style-guide-block-text" markdown="1">
Operating the ‘print’ command will open a dialogue box including instructions for using pre-printed letterhead stock. When using pre-printed stock you need to hide BVN graphics (toggle print graphics) and print on one side only.

Pre-printed letterheads incorporate the BVN mark and relevant address with 5 different graphic backgrounds.
