ONE WAY REFERENCING

Always reference from a larger scale drawing to a more detailed-one, eg from **1:100** floor plan in ‘B’ series to corresponding **1:50** plan in ‘G’ series.

Always reference ‘one step at a time’. In the example above, make reference to **1:20** detail of a joinery item in ‘M’ series, but only from ‘G’ series. Do not draw ‘a box within a box’ in ‘B’ series general arrangement plan.
