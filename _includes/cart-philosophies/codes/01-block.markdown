BENEFITS

- Codes increase flexibility, efficiency and accuracy and accommodate design changes during the Construction Documentation phase.
  - eg
  - A portion of a facade is given the code CLAD-2 and described on the legend sheet as ‘COMPOSITE ALUMINIUM SANDWICH PANEL’. CLAD-2 as description will be frequently used in numerous parts of the Architectural Drawing Set.
  - Should the cladding change to ‘PATTERNATED STAINLESS STEEL PANEL WITH BACKING BOARD’, the update is necessary only to the CLAD-2 description on the legend sheet and to the specifications.
  - The description elsewhere in the drawing set does not need to change.
  - Only the legend sheet and specifications need to be re-issued and the rest of the drawing set is automatically up-to-date.

 -  Specification writers appreciate code because it gives them an all-inclusive listing of systems, materials and finishes, and consequently assures completeness of the specifications.
