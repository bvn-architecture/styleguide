This is a list of codes for describing commonly used systems, materials and finishes. Some projects may require special or new codes, this list is to be used as a common starting point for developing the codes specifically tailored to your project. If you need to allocate a new code, make sure the combination of the letters is derived from generic description of the item and is intuitively recognisable by the user.

Codes ending with ‘S’ commonly refer to systems, as in EXTERNAL WALL SYSTEM.

Avoid nominating proprietary products. Use generic descriptions of systems, materials and finishes.
