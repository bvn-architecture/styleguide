THE BENEFITS OF PRODUCING A STORYBOARD:

The purpose of storyboarding is to provide the team with
the following information:

- Drawing numbers
- Drawing titles
- Layout and titles of drawings within a drawing sheet (up to **1:20** scale)

The storyboard shows the global picture.

It eradicates the need to reinvent the rules.

Naming conventions are consistent throughout the set.

In the general storyboard, sheets of details (a scale larger than **1:20**) are only numbered and inserted into the set.
