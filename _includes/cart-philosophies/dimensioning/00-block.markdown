USE GRIDS AND CENTRE LINES

Allow the building to ‘dimension itself’ as much as possible.

PRIORITY DIMENSIONING AND OPEN DIMENSIONS

Concentrate on critical dimensions (e.g.width of escape corridor). Leave non-critical dimension out of the dimension string.

RESTRICT THE USE OF RLS

Use relative heights ‘above finished floor level’ (AFFL) e.g.dimension the height of a handrail in millimeters.

IDENTIFY DIMENSIONS WHICH ARE NOT KNOWN

Dimensions to be determined during the construction
