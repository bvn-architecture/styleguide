    <h1>Corporate identity</h1>
    <p>The overall strategy of a studio is directly connected to its identity, and every marketing or communication element must purposefully and effectively spring from that strategy. A graphic identity is not an arbitrary design task to address specific problems or issues,</p>
    <p>it is a long-term strategy to be integrated fully with a long-term business strategy.</p>
    <p>Every architectural practice is unique, and their identity springs from the practiceâ€™s roots, its personality, its strength and its weaknesses. The identity of BVN must have such clarity, that it becomes the yardstick against which its design, behaviour and actions are measured.</p>
    <p>Our identity must be visible, tangible and all-embracing. Everything that the studio does must be an affirmation of its identity.</p>
    <p>All communication material must have a consistent quality and character that accurately and honestly reflects the whole studio and its aim. Hence the management of the identity is a task that requires the active and serious attention for all those involved.</p>
