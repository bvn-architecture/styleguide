Wall protection plans
(Graphic representation scenario) 1:100
As a second preference, in the case where the quantity and variation of wall protection systems (eg in a health care project) would make F series room schedule too complex to schedule, we resort to documenting it through graphic representation.
This approach creates another subset of 1:100 plans in the F series, used to graphically represent and identify wall protection systems.
