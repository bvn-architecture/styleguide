ROOM SCHEDULE SPREADSHEET LISTS EVERY SPACE, IDENTIFIED BY THE NAME AND NUMBER.
THE INFORMATION IS IDENTICAL WITH THE ROOM NAMES AND ROOM NUMBERS SHOWN IN
THE PLANS.
THE ROOM SCHEDULE PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF SPACES WHICH CONSTITUTE
THE PROJECT.

_(Materials and finishes codes allocated to the rooms in room schedule spreadsheet sufficiently describe substrate and finishes in majority of cases._
_For more complex internal spaces (eg lift lobby, auditorium), instead of trying to code it, draw the space at 1:50 scale in G series and write a note in schedule ‘FOR DETAILS REFER TO DRAWING AR-I-**-**’)_
